Play with Ansible Module

Imperative and Declarative 

Imperative: Very quick, can not execute sequence of tasks, if history of terminal got terminated not able to get it.

Declarative: Very good for long term point of view. Need to write a playbook to acheive it

Get the full list of Ansible Modules at 

ansible-doc --list
ansible-doc file
(File is name of the module and serach for EXAMPLE)


1	Creating Directory at Node
	ansible <TARGET HOSTNAME> -m file -a 'path=/tmp/data state=directory'
	EXAMPLE: ansible elite -m file -a 'path=/tmp/data state=directory'
Ensure that has directory created or not at your node

Ansible Playbook (YAML)

	-file:
       path: /tmp/data
       state: directory 

2	Copy file from Master to Node
	Refer ansible copy module
	ansible-doc copy

	ansible <TARGET HOSTNAME> -m copy -a 'src=hosts dest=/tmp/data' 
	Example: ansible elite -m copy -a 'src=hosts dest=/tmp/data'

Ensure that has file copied or not at your node

3	Experience with Convergence / Idempotent
	(Convergence / Idempotent: produce same results if executed once or multiple times)

	ansible <TARGET HOSTNAME> -m copy -a 'src=hosts dest=/root' 
	
Ensure that whether Convergence / Idempotent works or not

4	Add line to a Text file
	
	4.1)	Copy file to node before adding new line
	
	ansible <TARGET HOSTNAME> -m copy -a 'src=ansible.cfg dest=/tmp/data/ansible.cfg' 

	Search for module which allow to adding line 
	ansible-doc --list
	(search for lineinfile)
	ansible-doc lineinfile
	(search for EXAMPLE)
	
	4.2)	Adding new line
	ansible <TARGET HOSTNAME> -m lineinfile -a 'path=/tmp/data/ansible.cfg line="NEW LINE" '
	(Path : metioned node directory)

Ensure that whether has newline added or not your node

5	Install OS Packages (Web Server)
	ansible-doc package
	
	ansible <TARGET HOSTNAME> -m package -a 'name=nginx state=present'
	You get an error
	
	Apply below,
	ansible <TARGET HOSTNAME> -m package -a 'name=nginx state=present' --become
	
	Still, if you get an error
	Go to node, and get into directory of /etc/sudoers.d/
	Adding new file and name as rootuser
	At rootuser file, add as per below which is syntax of sudo
	root ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
	(root is a user name)
	ALL : All hosts
	ALL : All Users
	ALL : All groups
	ALL : All Commands wihtout asking Password

	ansible <TARGET HOSTNAME> -m package -a 'name=nginx state=present' --become

Ensure that Nginx installed or not by using below commands
	systemctl status nginx
	Run the nginx
	curl localhost
	

1	Copy file from master to Worker Node
	(Control machine to Target Host)

2	Exp with Convergence / Idempotent

3	Add line to a Text file

4	Install OS Packages (Web Server)

5	SUDO Access - Elevate Remote User Privileges
