Ansible notify when changed

In Ansible, a handler refers to a particular task that executes when triggered by the notify module

Handlers perform an action defined in the task when a change occurs in the remote host.

Handlers are helpful when you need to perform a task that relies on a specific taskâ€™s success or failure.

For example, you can set a handler to send logs if the service goes down.


To illustrate how to use the Ansible handler, let us a simple example. The playbook below will install the nginx server and use a handler to start the service.

---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
  - name: "install nginx"
    package:
      name: nginx
      state: present
    notify: startnginx
  handlers:
    - name: startnginx # Name same as notify
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started


In the example playbook above, we start by installing the nginx server using the package module. We then use a notify module to set a notify action

The final step is to configure a handler to run after the server is installed. 

The name of the notification should be the same as the name used in the handler module. Otherwise, the specified handler will fail.
